**Decentralized Habit Tracking on the Scroll Sepolia Testnet**

Scrolling Habits is an open-source, decen tralized application (dApp) that allows users to privately create and track habits completely on-chain. Built on the Scroll Sepolia Testnet, our dApp utilizes a simple ERC721 smart contract to provide a secure and transparent way to manage your habits.

**Key Features**

* **Private Habit Tracking**: Only the owner of a habit can view their own habits, ensuring complete privacy and security.
* **Simple and Complex Habits**: Create both simple habits (e.g., waking up at 7 am every day) and complex habits (e.g., tracking kilometers ran or hours practiced) with customizable metrics.
* **Immutable Entries**: Each habit has entries, consisting of a date and a value (1 for simple habits), stored on-chain forever, allowing users to track their progress over time.

**How it Works**

1. Users create habits, specifying whether they are simple or complex.
2. For complex habits, users define the metrics to track (e.g., kilometers, hours).
3. Users create entries for their habits, which are stored on-chain.
4. Only the owner of a habit can view their own habits and entries.

**Technical Details**

* Built on the Scroll Sepolia Testnet
* Utilizes a simple ERC721 smart contract for habit management
* Habit data is stored on-chain, ensuring immutability and transparency
